# Lab11: My First MVC App

## Introduction:

I created a web application using the .NET Core Framework which will allow a user to select a span of 2 different years and a list of people in that year will appear in a table.

## Requirements: 

Web application should be created from an empty web application template, with all controllers and views manually created, do not scaffold.

MVC Middleware and include template routing (the route must be explicitly defined)

Only 1 controller. The home controller, with 3 actions (2 Index, and 1 Results)

Upon posting back to the server, call the Results action to redirect to the results view.

Views to generate the home page and search results

Use a form tag to accept user input

Include HTML/CSS in your final product. This is required.

Enable use of Static Files in your website and create a style sheet and incorporate some creativity into your application.

A model class that contains the following properties(these are the headers of the csv file):

public int Year { get; set; }
public string Honor { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public string Country { get; set; }
public int Birth_Year { get; set; }
public int DeathYear { get; set; }
public string Title { get; set; }
public string Category { get; set; }
public string Context { get; set; }
